##Part 1: WeatherPy

#Temp vs Lat
Qualitatively it appears there is a strong positive correlation in the Southern Hemisphere as the r value is above 0.7. For the Northern hemisphere, the correlation is almost the same but inversed with a -0.8 r value. We can conclude, as you get closer to the equator, the temperature rises as expected

#Humidity vs Lat
Based on the r values for both hemispheres, there is almost no correlation between latitudes and humidity since the r values are so close to 0. I would have assumed that the humidity would rise near the equator, but that is not the case based on these graphs.

#Cloudiness vs Lat
Similarly to humidity, the r values for cloudiness vs latitude are close to 0 showing almost no correlation. This is something I would have assumed--that latitude should not have an effect on cloudiness.

 #Wind vs Lat
 Based on the r values, there is a minor correlation between wind speed and latitudes- with both hemispheres being just over 0.2.
